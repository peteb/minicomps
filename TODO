* Trace logging, statistics gathering, flow control
* Mutable responses (responses containing ptrs/refs)
* Reflection for dependencies, dependency verification

* Rename async_events to just events
* Call sync queries using async
* Async queries and events need to copy their arguments/decay
* Tests that enforce number of allocations
* Should we expose async/sync queries? What should the default be? What about async/sync events?
* Well-defined behavior when components are removed in the middle of a call
* any_unaligned_storage should fall back to heap allocated if needed
* Minicoros support
* Flag for forcing async even if sender and receiver are on the same executor
* Flag to toggle behavior for async queries when receiver has unloaded (cancel request/"black hole", raise error, resend (next frame), DLQ)
* lookup(query1, query2, query3) that works for both sync and async?
* Defer publishing to onLink (automatically)

* Improve executor performance
